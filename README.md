# Getty_TGN_Finder
This small library allows to query the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). 
Getty TGN is a structured vocabulary of geographic names for indexing art and architecture
information in Getty repositories. It contains over 1.3 million names for places, regions,
and physical features around the world. The TGN is available online through the Getty's website
and can be accessed by anyone free of charge.

The TGN includes not only current geographic names, but also historical and vernacular names,
as well as variant spellings and names in multiple languages. It provides information about the
hierarchical relationships between places, and also includes information about the administrative
divisions, cultural and physical features, and geographic coordinates of each place.

The TGN is used by museums, libraries, and other cultural heritage institutions to provide
standardized access to geographic information for their collections. It can also be used by
researchers and individuals interested in studying the history and geography of a particular
region or place.

## Example Code
```python
from Getty_Query_Class import Getty_TGN_Request
from Getty_Query_Class import Getty_TGN_Location
from pathlib import Path

dump ='Save_to_folder'
#get the results of a query for 'Tunganhsien'; the results will be saved as rdf files in the 'dump' folder
retrieved = Getty_TGN_Request('Tunganhsien', save_to_folder='dump')
#iterate through all the files in 'dump', search for the coordinates in the files, and print the results 
folder = Path('dump')
for file in folder.iterdir():
    if file.suffix == '.rdf':
        location = Getty_TGN_Location(folder, file.name)
        print(location.prettify(25))
```
**result:**
```python
#the prettify result:
#query, name found, type, code, latitude, longitude
Tunganhsien     Baiyashi        inhabited place 8201269 26.38883        111.262131
Tunganhsien     Datong Jiedao   fourth level subdivision        8208848 24.734833       118.143026
Tunganhsien     Zixishi fourth level subdivision        8687656 26.331  111.236
```


## Getty_TGN_Request class 
Overall, the Getty_TGN_Request class provides a convenient way to query the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names online database and retrieve data for specific places.
The class is used to manage a request for a query to the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) online database. 

To retrieve a query, you can simply create an instance of the class; if you desire to automatically save the rdf files, you can specify the folder name with the optional argument 'save_to_folder' as in the example below:

`retrieved = Getty_TGN_Request('query', save_to_folder='query_folder')`



**This class has the following methods and attributes:**

### __init__ method
The constructor for this class takes the following parameters:

query_name: a string that represents the name of the place to search for.
query_placetypeid: a string that represents the ID of the place type to search for (optional).
query_nationid: a string that represents the ID of the nation to search for (optional).
save_to_folder: a string that represents the path of the folder to save the results in (optional).
Upon initialization, the _mainlink, _placetype_attr, and _nation_attr variables are used to construct a URL to query the TGN online database with the provided parameters. The query results are then parsed and stored in the findings attribute. If a save_to_folder is provided, the results are saved to files in the specified directory.

### _XML_find_subjects method
This method takes an XML string as an input and returns a list of dictionaries that contain information about the found places. It first parses the XML string with ElementTree and then iterates over the preferred_parent elements to extract the data for each place.

### _extract_data method
This method takes a string that is organized as "A (Atype) [Acode], B (Btype) [Bcode], ..." and returns a list of dictionaries with the name, type, and ID of each place. It first splits the input string into individual nodes and then extracts the data for each node by replacing characters and splitting the resulting strings.

### print_findings method
This method prints the findings attribute in a readable format to the console. It first determines the maximum length of each block of data for all the found places and then prints each block of data for each place with the maximum length determined earlier.

### save_findings method
This method saves the results of the query to files in the specified directory. It first constructs a filename based on the query parameters and the data extracted from the first place in the findings list. It then retrieves the RDF data for the first place in the findings list and saves it to a file in the specified directory with the constructed filename.


## The Getty_TGN_Location class:
It manages the acquisition of the coordinates from the rdf file. The class takes two arguments: **folder** and **rdf_file**. The folder argument specifies the directory path where the rdf file is located, and the rdf_file argument specifies the rdf file name. If the folder argument is a string, it will be converted to a Path object. 

### The **__init__** method 
Initializes several instance variables, such as _folder, _filename, _data, query_name, result_name, result_type, result_id, **latitude**, and **longitude**. 

### get_data method 
Returns the contents of the rdf file as a string. 

### get_coordinates method 
Extracts the latitude and longitude coordinates from the rdf file. 

### prettify method 
Formats the class attributes into a string with tabs separating the fields.
