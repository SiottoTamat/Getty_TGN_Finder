# Getty_TGN_Finder
"""
This small library allows to query the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). 
Getty TGN is a structured vocabulary of geographic names for indexing art and architecture
information in Getty repositories. It contains over 1.3 million names for places, regions,
and physical features around the world. The TGN is available online through the Getty's website
and can be accessed by anyone free of charge.

The TGN includes not only current geographic names, but also historical and vernacular names,
as well as variant spellings and names in multiple languages. It provides information about the
hierarchical relationships between places, and also includes information about the administrative
divisions, cultural and physical features, and geographic coordinates of each place.

The TGN is used by museums, libraries, and other cultural heritage institutions to provide
standardized access to geographic information for their collections. It can also be used by
researchers and individuals interested in studying the history and geography of a particular
region or place.

With this library a python script can retrieve all the results of a search as .rdf files.

  retrieved = Getty_TGN_Request('query', save_to_folder='query_folder')

The Getty_TGN_Request class is used to manage a request for a query to the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) online database. This class has the following methods and attributes:

__init__ method
The constructor for this class takes the following parameters:

query_name: a string that represents the name of the place to search for.
query_placetypeid: a string that represents the ID of the place type to search for (optional).
query_nationid: a string that represents the ID of the nation to search for (optional).
save_to_folder: a string that represents the path of the folder to save the results in (optional).
Upon initialization, the _mainlink, _placetype_attr, and _nation_attr variables are used to construct a URL to query the TGN online database with the provided parameters. The query results are then parsed and stored in the findings attribute. If a save_to_folder is provided, the results are saved to files in the specified directory.

_XML_find_subjects method
This method takes an XML string as an input and returns a list of dictionaries that contain information about the found places. It first parses the XML string with ElementTree and then iterates over the preferred_parent elements to extract the data for each place.

_extract_data method
This method takes a string that is organized as "A (Atype) [Acode], B (Btype) [Bcode], ..." and returns a list of dictionaries with the name, type, and ID of each place. It first splits the input string into individual nodes and then extracts the data for each node by replacing characters and splitting the resulting strings.

print_findings method
This method prints the findings attribute in a readable format to the console. It first determines the maximum length of each block of data for all the found places and then prints each block of data for each place with the maximum length determined earlier.

save_findings method
This method saves the results of the query to files in the specified directory. It first constructs a filename based on the query parameters and the data extracted from the first place in the findings list. It then retrieves the RDF data for the first place in the findings list and saves it to a file in the specified directory with the constructed filename.

Overall, the Getty_TGN_Request class provides a convenient way to query the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names online database and retrieve data for specific places.
